# Master’s Thesis Repository (Dummy / Work in Progress)

This repository serves as a **temporary workspace** for the master’s thesis

**“Non-intrusive Reduced Order Models for Transient CFD in Automotive Applications.”**

At this stage, the repository is primarily used to:
- test directory structures,
- store intermediate data and visual material,
- collect scripts and files during thesis development.

> **Important:**  
> This repository is a **dummy / placeholder** and does **not** represent a finished or stable software project.  
> File names, folder structure, and contents are subject to frequent changes.

## Current Structure (Preliminary)

```text
data/        transient CFD benchmark data (snapshots, test cases)
docs/        draft visualisations and exploratory HTML outputs
figures/     images and videos used for analysis and presentations
src/         experimental scripts and analysis code
````

## Scope (Tentative)

The thesis investigates:

* non-intrusive reduced order models (NIROMs),
* transient internal CFD flows,
* dimensionality reduction (POD, DMD),
* data-driven surrogate modelling.

Details, usage instructions, and reproducibility guidelines will be added
once the methodology and implementation are finalised.

## Disclaimer

This repository is part of an **ongoing academic thesis project**.
Nothing here should be considered final, complete, or reusable at this point.
